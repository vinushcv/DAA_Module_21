# EX 3C Sudoku Solver
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the solution of sudoku puzzle using Backtracking.


## Algorithm
1. Find the first empty cell (cell with 0) in the Sudoku board.
2. Try placing numbers 1 to 9 in that empty cell.
3. For each number, check if it is safe (valid) to place by row, column, and 3×3 box rules.
4. If safe, place the number and recursively attempt to fill the next empty cell.
5. If the board is completely filled without conflicts, print the solution.
