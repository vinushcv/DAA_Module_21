# EX 3C Sudoku Solver
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the solution of sudoku puzzle using Backtracking.


## Algorithm
1. Find the first empty cell (cell with 0) in the Sudoku board.
2. Try placing numbers 1 to 9 in that empty cell.
3. For each number, check if it is safe (valid) to place by row, column, and 3Ã—3 box rules.
4. If safe, place the number and recursively attempt to fill the next empty cell.
5. If the board is completely filled without conflicts, print the solution.
